In this project, I worked with The Gaming Room, a client that wanted to expand their Android game Draw It or Lose It into a cross-platform web-based application that could scale and remain secure. My design document captured the requirements, constraints, and proposed architecture, including the use of the Singleton pattern to manage memory by limiting the game to one active instance. I believe I did especially well in comparing operating platforms and explaining how each could impact development and deployment, which gave me a stronger understanding of system trade-offs. Developing the document itself was valuable because it forced me to think critically about the design before moving into implementation, making the coding process clearer. If I were to revise any section, I would enhance the recommendations with additional details on cloud storage and distributed systems. I also ensured that I integrated user needs—such as unique team names, scalability, and secure communication—because keeping the user in mind is central to effective design. My approach relied on object-oriented design, platform evaluation, and secure development principles, and in the future I plan to keep using design documentation and structured analysis as strategies for building reliable software.
